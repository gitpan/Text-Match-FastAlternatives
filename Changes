	- declare dependency on Perl 5.6
	- update documentation for Perl 5.10
	- label this release as 1.00; the code has been stable for ages
	- if you're already using 0.04 or 0.05, there's no need to upgrade

1.01  Sun Aug 31 16:05:05 2008
	- more flexible: now fully supports Unicode
	- uses less memory: many nodes 376 bytes smaller on 32-bit systems
	- fractionally slower in some cases, but hard to measure the difference

1.02  Mon Sep  1 10:16:22 2008
	- fix test suite to work in Perl 5.10
	- an aside: on 64-bit CPUs, 1.01/1.02 are probably faster than 1.00
	- no code changes; if 1.01 works for you, there's no need to upgrade

1.03  Tue Sep  2 10:48:16 2008
	- fix test suite to work in Perl 5.6
	- no code changes; if 1.02 works for you, there's no need to upgrade
